# SebasChat
The aim of this project is to create a web interface in which the user can interact with SebastianAI, a ChatGPT personality inspired by Sebas Tian, the legendary butler of Ains Ooal Gown of the anime Overlord.

Planned features and goals of this project:
Phase 1, 2, and 3 are the initial goals of this project. If Phase 3 is completed successfully and I maintain interest in the project, I may choose to enable additional functionality such as multiple personalities, generate your AI's avatar right from the website, multiple voices, etc. I could see the project becoming a place for people to create and fine tune their very own personal assistant powered by AI, complete with Avatar and matching voice to truly bring their digital assistants to life.

Phase 1 -
1) Chat window in which the user can type and receive text-based responses from SebastianAI.
2) An avatar to represent SebastianAI, generated using AI.
3) Basic website functionality including styling, navigation.
4) 3 Main pages to the website: Home, Chat, About.

Phase 2 -
1) Text-to-voice integration to give life to SebastianAI.
2) Improve overall beauty of website, perhaps implement a UI library or a front end framework.

Phase 3 -
1) Basic animation for the avatar using additional AI generated images & editing software if needed.

Phase 4) -
TBD

Phase 5 -
TBD
